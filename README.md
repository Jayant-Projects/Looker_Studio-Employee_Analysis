# Employee Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of employees within an organization using Looker Studio. The analysis involved creating an interactive dashboard that provides insights into various aspects of the workforce.

## Project Workflow

Here's a summary of the workflow I followed:

1. **Data Preparation:** I began by uploading the dataset into Google Sheets, making it accessible for further analysis.

2. **Looker Studio:** I utilized Looker Studio to create an interactive dashboard. The data from Google Sheets was imported into the Looker Studio interface.

3. **Dashboard Components:** The dashboard included several components to answer specific questions and provide valuable insights:
   - **KPIs:** Key Performance Indicators such as Total Employees, Working Employees, Median Salary, Exit Rate, and Male/Female Ratio were displayed.
   - **Controls:** Interactive elements like Date Range, Department Drop-down, and Age Slider were integrated to allow users to customize their analysis.
   - **Top 10 Paid Employees:** A list of the top 10 highest-paid employees with their respective salaries was featured.
   - **Role Distribution:** The number of employees under each job title or role was visualized.
   - **Gender Ratio:** A pie chart showcased the percentage of male and female employees.
   - **Yearly Hiring Trends:** A time series chart illustrates the organization's hiring patterns over the years.
   - **Business Unit Strength:** Employee strength within each business unit was presented.
   - **Employee Location:** A bubble map displayed the geographical distribution of employees.

4. **Dashboard Theme:** A visually appealing theme was selected to enhance the overall dashboard design and user experience.
